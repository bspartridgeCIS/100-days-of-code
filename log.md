# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setting up Git-hub. As I am new to coding in general this is suprisingly challenging as I have never really thouched it before. I also started my Personal Portfolio for the Free Code Camp projects. I am dumbfounded by all the awesome ones people have built, I definitly am overwhlemed about where to start. We didn't actually learn that much yet so it is confusing where people are finding what does what. For example everyone is using " <div class="navbar navbar-default navbar-fixed-top" role="navigation">" Great....but how did you know that makes a nav bar...did you just google it?

**Thoughts:** Jumping into Github I already feel like I am learning a second language. I hope that this becomes second nature quickly.
